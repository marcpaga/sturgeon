## Installation

Get the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/marcpaga/sturgeon
```

### Optional
To include the models directly to the installation path, download the desired models, see below for available models and links.

And the move the models:
```
cd sturgeon
mv DOWNLOADED_MODEL.zip sturgeon/include/models/DOWNLOADED_MODEL.zip
```

Otherwise, during prediction, you can just pass the path to the zip file.

Install Sturgeon.

```
cd sturgeon # if you haven't

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install . --no-cache-dir
```

If you use a pre-compiled binary then there's no necessity for installation.

## Available models

Model files are zip files with the an `onnx` model file and several other files with information about the classes and model calibration.

The following models are available:

### `General`

- This model contains a similar classification scheme (some classes are merged, see below) as [Capper et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature26000). This means that there are a total of 87 classes (9 control and 78 tumor classes).
- We recommend to always use this model in parallel, even when using other models.
- Score recommendations:

    - `score < 0.8`: inconclusive result. We recommend to wait for additional data; if not possible, consider the top3 highest scoring classes or their class families as whole.
    - `0.8 <= score < 0.95`: confident result that the class is correct. If used during live sequencing, we recommend to wait for additional sequencing data so that the score gets higher, or the score is stable within this range (e.g several predictions like 0.82, 0.87, 0.84, ...).
    - `score >= 0.95`: high confident result that the class is correct.

Merged classes (these are merged since the subtype differences are based on tumour location or age):

- Embryonal - MB SHH - CHL AD INF merges: "Embryonal - MB SHH - CHL AD" and "Embryonal - MB SHH - INF"

- Ependymal - SUBEPN - ALL merges: "Ependymal - SUBEPN - PF", "Ependymal - SUBEPN - SPINE" and "Ependymal - SUBEPN - ST"

- Other glioma - LGG PA - PA merges: "Other glioma - LGG PA - PA MID" and "Other glioma - LGG PA - PA PF"


### `Brainstem`

- This model constains a reduced number of classes (30) that can only occur in the brainstem region. Included in these classes are also the control classes and a `Other - Non brainstem` class.
- We recommend to always use the general model in parallel with this one.
- This model is only meant to be used when the tumor is located in the brainstem.
- Score recommendations:
    - `score < 0.95`: inconclusive result. We recommend to wait for additional data; if not possible, consider the top3 highest scoring classes or their class families as whole.
    - `score >= 0.95`: high confident result that the class is correct, but should be treated as inconclusive is the predicted class is `Other - Non brainstem`.

## Quickstart

This program has four main utilities:

- `inputtobed`: convert input files from Guppy (bam) or from Megalodon (txt), to bed files suitable to be used for prediction using this tool.
- `predict`: predict the CNS type from an input file(s) in bed format.
- `models`: list, add and delete models. Not strictly necessary, as models can be passed to the previous utilities by path. Ignore for binary programs.

Once launched, a log file will be created in the `logs` folder. The location of that folder will be dependent from the current working directory (from where the tool is executed).
Please refer to each utility `--help` for additional info.

### CRITICAL NOTES:
- Prediction relies on proper mapping of the methylation calls. This program expects that the reads have aligned to the [T2T reference genome v2.0](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies/analysis_set/chm13v2.0.fa.gz). We also support alignment to `hg38`, but have NOT throughly tested it.


## Preparing data into the right format: `inputtobed`

Convert input files (bam or txt) to bed files that can be used as input to predict the CNS type.

It is critical that the data is correctly aligned to a reference genome, otherwise the results will be wrong. We have used the Telomere-to-telomere reference genome (CHM13v2) for all of our work, and it is the default setting for this program. We encourage you to also use it, as we have not thoroughly tested other reference genomes. If you have aligned your data to `hg38`, we encourage you to re-align (or "lift it" with [CrossMap](https://crossmap.sourceforge.net/#)) it to the T2T reference genome. If you still prefer to use `hg38`, then you can pass `--reference-genome hg38` to use the correct probe coordinates. The `hg38` coordinates have been generated via liftover, this lead to the loss of 26 out of 427680 probes.

### Extract modification calls: modkit (recommended)

If you have bam files that contain modifications basecalled with Guppy or Dorado, this is the recommended option. You will have to install [modkit](https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit), the official ONT tool to extract modifications. Once installed, given a bam file you should do the following:

1. (optional) If, besides 5mC you also have 5hmC modification calls, you should add them up via:
```
modkit adjust-mods --convert h m INPUT.bam OUTPUT.bam
```
The reasoning behind this is that both 5mC and 5hmC poorly react to bisulfite treatment [Huang et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2811190/), therefore 5hmC sites would appear as 5mC in a methylation microarray experiment. We trained on those kind of experiments, we therefore think that adding the two scores up reflects the most the training data.

2. You can then extract the 5mC scores using:
```
modkit extract OUTPUT.bam OUTPUT.txt
```

This `OUTPUT.txt` can then be directly used in sturgeon using:
```
sturgeon inputtobed -i MODKIT_OUTPUT_DIR -o OUTPUT_DIR -s modkit
```

Please note that Sturgeon will only use 5mC scores, other modification scores will be filtered out.
Please refer to the [modkit wiki](https://nanoporetech.github.io/modkit/quick_start.html) in case these commands change.

### Extract modification calls: modkit pileup

Similarly to `modkit extract`, you can use pileup to extract the modification calls into a single file with all the genomic positions, instead of modification calls per read.

In that case use the following command:
```
sturgeon inputtobed -i MODKIT_PILEUP_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE -s modkit_pileup
```


## CNS type prediction: `predict`

This mode predicts a set of samples in bed file format given a set of models.
Each bed file is considered to be a single sample and is treated independently.

Example usage with the demo data:
```
sturgeon predict \
-i demo/bed \
-o demo/bed/results/ \
--model-files PATH_TO_MODEL_DIR/general.zip \
--plot-results
```

In `demo/results` there should be a `.csv` file for each sample with the scores for each CNS class. There should also be a `.pdf` with a barplot representing the predicted scores.

Values indicate the score that the model gave to each class. Higher scores indicate higher confidence in the prediction.


# Deprecated

## Input sources

The following inputs are deprecated, please use [modkit](https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit), to extract methylation calls from bam files from guppy/dorado.

### Alignment bam files: guppy (not recommended)

Please strongly consider using [modkit](https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit), to extract methylation calls from bam files from guppy we rely on [modbampy](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/modbam2bed/tree/master), which is currently deprecated. Updates to guppy might break modbampy compatibility and could give WRONG results.

Convert a bam that contains methylation calls into the adequate format (.bed) so that it can be used for prediction.

To obtain bam files from Guppy you can add the following arguments:
```
.guppy_basecaller \
--config dna_r9.4.1_e8.1_modbases_5mc_cg_hac.cfg \
--bam_out \
--align_ref chm13v2.0.fa
```

Do NOT pass the `--index` flag to get index files, these index files are not compatible.
Also remember to pass the T2T reference genome v2.0 as reference for alignment.

Convert bam to bed example with demo data:

```
sturgeon inputtobed -i demo/bam -o demo/bam/out -s guppy
```

In `demo/bam/out` you should have some output files, the most important one is `merged_probes_methyl_calls.bed` as it is the input for the prediction tool. This input contains the aggregation of all methylation calls across ALL bam files. If each bam file is a different sample, then process them independently in different folders.

```
sturgeon inputtobed -i demo/bam/example_1.bam -o demo/bam/out_1 -s guppy
sturgeon inputtobed -i demo/bam/example_2.bam -o demo/bam/out_2 -s guppy
sturgeon inputtobed -i demo/bam/example_3.bam -o demo/bam/out_3 -s guppy
```

### Per read methylation txt files: megalodon (not recommended)

Please strongly consider using [modkit](https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit), to extract methylation calls since megalodon is deprecated by ONT.

Convert a txt file that contains per read methylation calls into the adequate format (.bed) so that it can be used for prediction.

To obtain the txt files you can run megalodon with the following arguments:
```
./megalodon YOUR_FAST5_PATH \
--outputs mods basecalls mappings \
--mappings-format bam \
--reference chm13v2.0.fa \
--write-mods-text \
--mod-motif m CG 0 \
--processes 10 \
--guppy-config res_dna_r941_prom_modbases_5mC_CpG_v001.cfg \
--devices cuda:0 \
--output-directory YOUR_OUTPUT_PATH
```

For further information on how to run megalodon please refer to their [github](https://github.com/nanoporetech/megalodon) page.

Convert txt files from demo data:
```
sturgeon inputtobed -i demo/mega -o demo/mega/out -s megalodon
```

In `demo/mega/out` you should have some output files, the most important one is `merged_probes_methyl_calls.bed` as it is the input for the prediction tool. This input contains the aggregation of all methylation calls across ALL bam files. If each bam file is a different sample, then process them independently in different folders.

## CNS type prediction while sequencing: `live`

This has been DEPRECATED since the library that we required to extract methylation calls from bam files has been DEPRECATED by ONT. If you need live prediction, its best to write custom scripts that check for new files and call the appropiate commands from modkit and sturgeon.

### Old documentation

This program can be used during live basecalling. It watches over a folder and waits for bam files (output of Guppy) or txt files (output of Megalodon) to be written there. Then it processes them as they come. This program expects that all bam files in that folder come from the same sample, therefore the amount of sequencing for that sample increases over time. In this line, each bam file will not be treated independently, but instead they will be added in a cumulative manner.

Example usage with demo data (guppy bam files):
```
sturgeon live \
-i demo/bam \
-o demo/bam/out_live \
-s guppy \
--model-files PATH_TO_MODEL_DIR/general.zip \
--plot-results
```

Example usage with demo data (megalodon txt files):
```
sturgeon live \
-i demo/mega \
-o demo/mega/out_live \
-s megalodon \
--model-files PATH_TO_MODEL_DIR/general.zip \
--plot-results
```

The tool needs to be stopped manually because it will wait infinitely for new files in the target folder. In most systems CTRL+C should interrupt and exit the program.

In the output folder there will be a bunch of intermediate files, the most important ones are:

- `predictions_modelname.csv`: which contains the predicted scores for each CNS class. Each row contains the cumulative predicitions, so row 1 are just the predictions for the first bam file, row 2 are the predictions for the first and second bam files combined, etc.
- `predictions_n_modelname.pdf`: these contains barplots for each of the rows in the previous described csv file.
- `predictions_overtime_modelname.pdf`: this contains a plot that describes the change in scores over time. Only classes with an average score >0.1 over time are plotted.
